Hellooo, I’m Binh or VB (V is my middle name). I'm currently studying my Bachelor of Computing, majoring in Cybersecurity, at Curtin University!
My main interest is Web Development, AI and obviously...Cybersecurity

I’m currently learning Java, C and how to exit out of Vim (thats a joke)

Language I'm fairly confident at: Python, JS/ReactJS and Assembly 🥸

Aspiring to become a Pentester or SOC Analyst!
